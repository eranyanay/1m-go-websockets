## This script helps regenerating multiple client instances in different network namespaces using Docker
## This helps to overcome the ephemeral source port limitation
## Usage: ./connect <connections> <number of clients> <server ip>
## Server IP is usually the Docker gateway IP address, which is 172.17.0.1 by default
## Number of clients helps to speed up connections establishment at large scale, in order to make the demo faster
